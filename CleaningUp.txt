pacman -Qqe | grep -v base > ~/packages.txt
# will create a text file in you home directory with a list of all of the packages you have explicitly installed
# other than base. Open the file in a text editor. Delete any packages you want to keep. 
# When you are done, save the file. It should now contain a list of the explicitly installed packages you 
# would like to remove. Remove them by running:

pacman -Rs < ~/packages.txt

# If you aren't sure what a particular package does, use:

pacman -Qii $PACKAGE_NAME
#or look it up on the wiki. 
#Be sure to leave things like Xorg/Wayland, pulseaudio, graphics drivers etc. alone unless you actually want to 
# go through the trouble of reinstalling them.

# Also, I don't know of a way to check when a package was last used, but you can look at:

cat /var/log/pacman.log 
# to see when different packages where installed or updated.

# Additionally, if running:

pacman -Rs <~/packages.txt
# fails because packages in that list are required by another program you're not removing, 
# then you'll need to take them off that list, but I also suggest putting them into another list,
#say, ~/dependencies.txt. Continue this until the first command succeeds. Now, you can run:

pacman -D --asdeps <~/dependencies.txt
# which will mark those as automatically installed, so when they're no longer required then they'll be removed 
# with any given:

pacman -Rs

Every so often I'll look through my list of explicitly installed packages, and set any I don't actually want as dependencies, making sure they'll be removed as soon as they're not needed.
